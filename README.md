Intelligent Driver Alert System is a safety-driven project that utilizes the CAN protocol to monitor and alert drivers based on environmental conditions inside a vehicle. It integrates LM35 temperature sensor and MQ2 gas sensor to detect cabin temperature and hazardous gases such as smoke or LPG leaks. The collected data is processed by a microcontroller(STM32) and transmitted via CAN communication to another microcontroller(STM32). Alerts are triggered when predefined thresholds are exceeded. Additionally, the system leverages IoT platform for remote data visualization and analysis, enabling cloud-based monitoring.
